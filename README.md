# DSP-Project
Developed a Python-based tool to analyze Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)
and calculate Third-Order Intercept Points (IP3) from WAV files using FFT
Automated analysis for multiple audio files, generating FFT spectra with
highlighted peaks.
Enhanced skills in Python, signal processing, and data visualization
